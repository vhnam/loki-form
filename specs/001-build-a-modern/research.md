# Research Findings: Modern Section-Based Form Builder

**Feature**: 001-build-a-modern  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish implementation approach

## Multi-Language Support Implementation

### Decision: Use next-intl with English and Vietnamese initially

**Rationale**:

- next-intl provides excellent Next.js 15 App Router integration
- Supports both static and dynamic translations
- Built-in TypeScript support for type-safe translations
- Minimal bundle impact with tree-shaking
- Easy to extend with additional languages

**Alternatives considered**:

- react-i18next: More complex setup, larger bundle size
- Custom i18n solution: Unnecessary complexity for standard use case
- Server-side only translations: Limits dynamic content capabilities

**Implementation approach**:

- Start with English (en-US) and Vietnamese (vi-VN) based on existing message files
- Use static translations for UI elements
- Support dynamic translations for form content
- Implement language switcher in user profile

## Real-Time Collaboration Architecture

### Decision: WebSocket-based collaboration with optimistic updates

**Rationale**:

- WebSockets provide low-latency bidirectional communication
- Optimistic updates ensure responsive UI during network delays
- Conflict resolution through operational transformation
- Scalable with Redis for multi-instance deployments

**Alternatives considered**:

- Server-Sent Events: One-way communication insufficient for collaboration
- Polling: High latency and resource usage
- WebRTC: Overkill for form editing, complex setup

**Implementation approach**:

- WebSocket connection per form editing session
- Operational transformation for concurrent edits
- Redis pub/sub for multi-instance coordination
- Graceful degradation when WebSocket unavailable

## Form Versioning Strategy

### Decision: Auto-increment versioning with manual version control

**Rationale**:

- Auto-increment ensures every change is tracked
- Manual versioning allows form creators to mark significant milestones
- Version history enables rollback capabilities
- Published forms maintain version stability

**Alternatives considered**:

- Manual versioning only: Risk of missing incremental changes
- Git-like versioning: Too complex for form creators
- No versioning: Cannot track changes or rollback

**Implementation approach**:

- Auto-increment on every save (draft versions)
- Manual version creation for published forms
- Version comparison and diff visualization
- Rollback to any previous version

## Form Analytics Requirements

### Decision: Comprehensive analytics with privacy compliance

**Rationale**:

- Submission tracking for form performance
- Completion rate analysis for UX optimization
- Response time analytics for performance monitoring
- Privacy-first approach with data anonymization

**Alternatives considered**:

- Basic submission counting: Insufficient for optimization
- Full user tracking: Privacy concerns and compliance issues
- Third-party analytics: Data ownership and integration complexity

**Implementation approach**:

- Submission count and completion rates
- Average completion time per form
- Field-level analytics (abandonment points)
- Export capabilities for form creators
- GDPR-compliant data handling

## Next.js 15 App Router Patterns

### Decision: Server-first architecture with selective client components

**Rationale**:

- App Router provides better performance and SEO
- Server components reduce client bundle size
- Selective hydration for interactive features
- Built-in loading and error boundaries

**Alternatives considered**:

- Pages Router: Legacy approach, less performant
- Full client-side rendering: Poor SEO and initial load performance
- Static generation only: Limits dynamic form capabilities

**Implementation approach**:

- Server components for form listing and static content
- Client components for form builder and real-time features
- Route groups for authentication and public forms
- Parallel routes for dashboard layout

## Database Schema Design

### Decision: Normalized schema with JSON fields for flexibility

**Rationale**:

- Normalized tables for core entities (users, forms, sections)
- JSON fields for question configurations and submission data
- PostgreSQL JSON support provides query flexibility
- Drizzle ORM ensures type safety

**Alternatives considered**:

- Fully normalized: Complex queries for form structure
- Document-based (MongoDB): Less ACID compliance
- Hybrid approach: Best of both worlds

**Implementation approach**:

- Users, Forms, Sections as separate tables
- Questions table with JSON configuration field
- Submissions table with JSON data field
- Proper indexing for performance

## Authentication Strategy

### Decision: JWT with refresh tokens and session management

**Rationale**:

- Stateless authentication for scalability
- Refresh tokens for security
- Session management for form editing state
- Integration with Next.js middleware

**Alternatives considered**:

- Session-based only: Server state management complexity
- OAuth only: Dependency on external providers
- Custom token system: Security and maintenance overhead

**Implementation approach**:

- JWT access tokens (15-minute expiration)
- Refresh tokens (7-day expiration)
- Secure HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- Middleware for route protection

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Decision: Multi-layered caching with CDN integration

**Rationale**:

- Edge caching for static assets
- Database query caching for form data
- Client-side caching for form builder state
- Image optimization for form previews

**Alternatives considered**:

- No caching: Poor performance and user experience
- Full client-side caching: Memory usage and stale data issues
- Server-side only: Limited performance gains

**Implementation approach**:

- Vercel Edge Network for static assets
- Redis for database query caching
- React Query for client-side state management
- Optimized images with Next.js Image component

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive testing pyramid with TDD approach

**Rationale**:

- Unit tests for business logic and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Contract tests for API compatibility

**Alternatives considered**:

- Testing after implementation: Higher bug rates and maintenance cost
- E2E only: Slow feedback and flaky tests
- No testing: Unreliable application

**Implementation approach**:

- Vitest for frontend unit tests
- Jest for backend unit tests
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Contract tests for API endpoints
- 80%+ coverage for critical paths

## Security Considerations

### Decision: Defense-in-depth security approach

**Rationale**:

- Multiple security layers for comprehensive protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits and updates

**Alternatives considered**:

- Basic security only: Vulnerable to common attacks
- Over-engineering: Unnecessary complexity and cost
- Third-party security only: Limited control and customization

**Implementation approach**:

- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention via Drizzle ORM
- XSS protection with proper sanitization
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Regular dependency updates and security scanning

## Deployment and Infrastructure

### Decision: Containerized deployment with CI/CD pipeline

**Rationale**:

- Consistent deployment across environments
- Automated testing and deployment
- Scalable infrastructure
- Easy rollback capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:

- Manual deployment: Error-prone and time-consuming
- Serverless only: Cold start issues and vendor lock-in
- Traditional hosting: Limited scalability and automation

**Implementation approach**:

- Docker containers for applications
- Vercel for frontend deployment
- Railway/Render for backend deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated testing in pipeline
