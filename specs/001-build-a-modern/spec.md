# Feature Specification: Modern Section-Based Form Builder

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-modern`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a modern, section-based form builder application built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript, organized as a Turborepo monorepo. Create dynamic forms with multiple field types, organized sections, comprehensive question management, and real-time form building capabilities. The application features a complete authentication system, multi-language support, and a robust backend API built with NestJS."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a form creator, I want to build dynamic, multi-section forms with various field types so that I can collect structured data from users efficiently and professionally.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is authenticated, **When** they access the form builder, **Then** they can create a new form with multiple sections
2. **Given** a form creator is building a form, **When** they add a new section, **Then** they can organize questions within that section
3. **Given** a form creator is adding questions, **When** they select a field type, **Then** they can configure field-specific properties and validation rules
4. **Given** a form creator is building a form, **When** they make changes, **Then** they can see a real-time preview of how the form will appear to end users
5. **Given** a form creator has completed a form, **When** they publish it, **Then** end users can access and submit the form
6. **Given** an end user is filling out a form, **When** they complete required fields, **Then** they can submit the form successfully
7. **Given** a form creator wants to manage their forms, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they can view, edit, and delete their forms
8. **Given** a user wants to access the application, **When** they visit the site, **Then** they can sign up or sign in to access form building features

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a form creator tries to create a form without any sections?
- How does the system handle form submissions when required fields are missing?
- What happens when a form creator deletes a section that contains questions?
- How does the system handle concurrent editing of the same form by multiple users?
- What happens when a form submission fails due to network issues?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create new forms with customizable titles and descriptions
- **FR-002**: System MUST support organizing form content into multiple sections with custom section names
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide multiple field types including text input, number input, date picker, dropdown selection, checkbox, and radio buttons
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow form creators to configure field properties such as labels, placeholders, validation rules, and required status
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time preview functionality showing how forms will appear to end users
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow form creators to save drafts and publish completed forms
- **FR-007**: System MUST enable end users to access and submit published forms
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate form submissions according to configured rules and provide appropriate error messages
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a dashboard for form creators to manage their forms (view, edit, delete, view submissions)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support user authentication with sign-up, sign-in, and password reset functionality
- **FR-011**: System MUST support multiple languages for the user interface [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which languages should be supported initially?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist form data and user submissions reliably
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow form creators to duplicate existing forms as templates
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide form analytics showing submission counts and completion rates [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific analytics are needed?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle form versioning when forms are edited after publication [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how should versioning work - auto-increment, manual versioning, or both?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: Represents form creators and end users, with authentication credentials, profile information, and form ownership
- **Form**: Represents a complete form with metadata (title, description, status, creation date) and relationships to sections
- **Section**: Represents a logical grouping of questions within a form, with ordering and display properties
- **Question**: Represents individual form fields with type, configuration, validation rules, and positioning within sections
- **Form Submission**: Represents completed form data submitted by end users, linked to the original form and submission timestamp
- **User Session**: Represents authenticated user sessions for access control and form management
